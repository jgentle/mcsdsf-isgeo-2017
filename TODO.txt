Do Outs on Watermark

NOW:
- Define schema for JsonData model (if necessary).
- Define schema for Configuration data model.
- Define schema for Insight data model (may delay this until Dashboard is fully functional).
- Refactor controllers to use new data models.
- Create CRUD capabilities for all data models.
- Load, parse and validate source data (CSV, GeoJSON then TSV, JSON and TopoJSON).
- Store validated sourcedata in jsondata collection.
- Display subdocuments in CRUD views (create, edit, show, etc.) as appropriate.
- Retrieve complete Formulation from db and use to configure and populate dashboard.
  -- Decouple Leaflet from hard coded input values.
  -- Decouple Crossfilter from hard coded input values.
  -- Decouple DC.js from hard coded input values.
    --- Consider using pure D3 instead of DC.js if required.
  -- Create sub/pub listeners to update views based on user interactions with filters.
- Add UI to load Formulation into dashboard.

THEN:
- Add UI to save current formulation configuration and settings as an Insight.
- Add UI to load an Insight into dashboard.
  -- Insights are currently children (subdocuments) of a formulation.
  -- May need to refactor Insight model to act as an all-in-one file to populate the dashboard.
    --- Would help with generating embed objects and publishing findings.

MAYBE:
- Packaged up as an Electron application
- Dockerize for simple deployment.

HOUSE KEEPING:
- Update README
- Add setup/installation instructions
- Add usage instructions
  -- Create a tutorial view
  -- Create an FAQ view
